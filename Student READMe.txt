Understanding the Knowledge Base Files:
vespa_activities_kb.json:
Content: A rich list of VESPA-related activities. Each activity has:
id: Unique identifier.
name: Activity title.
vespa_element: VISION, EFFORT, SYSTEMS, PRACTICE, ATTITUDE.
level: Seems to indicate target educational level (e.g., "2", "3", "" for general).
research_basis: Underpinning research/theory.
short_summary & long_summary: Descriptions of the activity.
keywords: For searching/tagging.
pdf_link: Direct link to the activity resource.
related_activities: IDs of other relevant activities.
Use Case: Perfect for the AI to suggest specific, actionable tasks to students based on their needs or areas for development.
coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json:
Content: Structured coaching questions.
generalIntroductoryQuestions: Good for starting conversations or general reflection.
conditionalFramingStatements: Provides context-sensitive introductory phrases based on the student's overall VESPA score profile (e.g., "low_4_or_5_scores"). This is powerful for personalizing the AI's tone.
vespaSpecificCoachingQuestions: Questions categorized by VESPA element, student's educational level (Level 2, Level 3), and their score interpretation (High, Medium, Low, Very Low).
vespaSpecificCoachingQuestionsWithActivities: Crucially, this section directly links specific coaching questions to related_activity_ids from vespa_activities_kb.json. This creates a direct bridge from a coaching question to a suggested intervention.
Use Case: Enables the AI to ask highly relevant, targeted questions and seamlessly suggest activities.
Strategy for RAG Enhancement & AI Feature Optimization:
The goal is to move beyond basic keyword matching to a more intelligent retrieval system that leverages the structure and content of these new JSON files.
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing (Backend - app.py):
Ensure both vespa_activities_kb.json and coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json are loaded at application startup.
Crucial: Your backend will need logic to interpret a student's numerical VESPA scores (e.g., 1-10) and map them to the qualitative categories used in coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json (High, Medium, Low, Very Low). You'll need to define the score ranges for these categories. For example:
Very Low: 1-2
Low: 3-4
Medium: 5-7
High: 8-10
(These are examples; adjust based on your scoring system).
The "Level" (Level 2, Level 3) in coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json seems to refer to the student's educational level (GCSE vs. A-Level, inferred from the questions). The backend needs to know the student's current level to pick the correct set of questions.
2. Enhancing the Retrieval Mechanism for AI Chat:
Contextual Retrieval: When a student interacts with the chat, or when the AI proactively offers guidance:
Access Student Data: The AI needs the student's current VESPA scores, their educational level, and potentially a summary of their academic/questionnaire data.
Query Understanding: Analyze the student's message and chat history to understand intent and identify key themes or VESPA elements being discussed.
Retrieving from coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json:
Conditional Framing: Based on the student's overall VESPA profile, retrieve the relevant conditionalFramingStatements to set an appropriate tone.
Targeted Questions & Activities:
If the conversation focuses on a specific VESPA element (or if the AI identifies a weak area from the student's profile), retrieve questions from vespaSpecificCoachingQuestionsWithActivities corresponding to the student's educational level and their score category (High, Medium, Low, Very Low) for that element.
This retrieval will yield both targeted questions and related_activity_ids.
Retrieving from vespa_activities_kb.json:
Direct Activity Suggestion: Use the related_activity_ids obtained from the coaching questions to fetch full activity details (name, summary, PDF link) from vespa_activities_kb.json.
Semantic/Keyword Search: If the student asks a more general question (e.g., "How can I improve my focus?" which might map to 'Effort' or 'Systems'), implement a search over activity name, keywords, and short_summary / long_summary. This could be:
Enhanced keyword matching.
Embedding-based semantic search (more complex but more powerful).
Filter searches by vespa_element if the context is clear.
3. Augmenting the LLM Prompt for Chat:
The retrieved information (framing statements, coaching questions, activity details) should be injected into the LLM's system prompt or as few-shot examples.
Prompt Guidance:
Instruct the LLM to use the conditionalFramingStatements at the beginning of its response if appropriate.
Guide the LLM to weave the retrieved vespaSpecificCoachingQuestions naturally into the conversation.
When suggesting activities, instruct the LLM to present them clearly (e.g., "Here's an activity that might help: [Activity Name]. It's about [Activity Short Summary]. You can find it here: [PDF Link]").
Encourage the LLM to use the related_activities field from an activity to suggest further steps if a student finds a particular activity helpful.
4. Optimizing Specific AI Features:
AI Chat Proactivity:
On panel open, or if the student seems unsure where to start, the AI could analyze the student's profile (e.g., lowest VESPA score), retrieve relevant conditionalFramingStatements and vespaSpecificCoachingQuestionsWithActivities, and initiate a conversation like:
AI: "I see you're looking to explore your VESPA profile. [Conditional Framing Statement if applicable]. I noticed your score for Vision is [Score Category]. Would you be open to exploring that a bit? For example, [Coaching Question for Vision/Score/Level]? We could even look at an activity like '[Activity Name]' which helps with [Activity Purpose]."
"What area to focus on?" Button (in chat):
Instead of generic common problems, this button could trigger the AI to:
Identify the student's lowest VESPA score(s) or areas discussed as challenging.
Retrieve 1-2 top questions from vespaSpecificCoachingQuestionsWithActivities for those areas.
Present these questions to the student as starting points for discussion, immediately linking to potential activities.
LLM-Generated Static Insights (Dashboard):
While the primary use of these KBs is for interactive chat, the concepts and language within them can refine the prompts for generating static insights:
student_overview_summary: Can be enhanced by understanding the types of challenges and solutions presented in the coaching questions for different score profiles.
chart_comparative_insights (VESPA): Could subtly refer to the themes of activities for a student's lower-scoring VESPA elements (e.g., "For 'Systems', many students find it helpful to focus on organization strategies, like those in activities X and Y.").
academic_performance_ai_summary: If academic struggles correlate with certain VESPA areas (e.g., low 'Effort' and poor grades), the summary could gently bridge this, informed by the coaching questions for 'Effort'.
5. Addressing Other Points from "Road Ahead & Potential Next Steps":
psychometric_question_details_kb & '100 statements - 2023.txt':
The handover mentions psychometric_question_details_kb for processing questionnaire scores. Ensure this is robustly loaded and used.
The log indicating '100 statements - 2023.txt' was not found needs investigation. If this file is crucial for questionnaire analysis or another KB, it must be located, added to the repository, and deployed. Update any loading logic if the filename/path is incorrect.
Knowledge Base Integrity: Regularly review and update all KBs. The new JSON files are a great start; ensure they are maintained.
Sophisticated Icons/Animations/Accessibility: These are good UI goals to keep in mind for future iterations.
Error Handling & Resilience (Backend): Continue to improve this, especially around Knack API calls and LLM interactions.
Caching: Definitely consider caching for Knack data and perhaps even for frequently retrieved KB content if it proves to be a bottleneck.
Implementation Steps Example (Conceptual for Chat):
Student sends a message: "I'm not sure how to improve my Vision score."
Backend:
Identifies "Vision" as the VESPA element.
Retrieves student's profile: VESPA Vision score is '3' (mapped to 'Low'), educational level is 'Level 3'.
Accesses coaching_questions_knowledge_base.json:
Finds vespaSpecificCoachingQuestionsWithActivities.Vision["Level 3"].Low.
Picks a question: "What does success look like for you? What might you want to achieve in the next year?"
Notes related activity ID, e.g., "VI31".
Accesses vespa_activities_kb.json:
Retrieves details for "VI31" ("20 Questions").
Optionally, retrieves a relevant conditionalFramingStatement.
LLM Prompt Augmentation: Context includes the selected question and activity details.
AI Responds: "Thanks for asking about Vision. It's great you're thinking about that. To start, what does success look like for you? What might you want to achieve in the next year? Sometimes, an activity like '20 Questions' can help explore this. It's designed to help you reflect by answering thought-provoking questions."
By implementing these strategies, your Student AI Academic Mentor will become a much more nuanced, targeted, and effective coaching tool, directly leveraging your valuable knowledge bases.
Before I proceed with any specific code changes or further analysis, would you like me to focus on a particular aspect of this integration, for example, drafting the backend logic for mapping scores and retrieving questions, or refining the LLM prompt structure for the chat?
Finally, as per your project rule, I can help you add, commit, and push these changes to your GitHub repository once we've refined the approach and made any necessary modifications.
