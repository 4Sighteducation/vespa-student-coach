  "description": "Research from the University of Toronto highlights that language can indicate a student's locus of control. 'Divers' often use language reflecting an external locus (e.g., 'I deserve X grade', 'the test was unfair', 'I will receive a grade'), while 'Thrivers' use language reflecting an internal locus (e.g., 'I will earn X grade', 'I need to achieve X by doing Y').",
  "implications_for_tutor": "When analyzing student comments or goals, note language patterns. If externalizing language is prevalent, it's a coaching opportunity to help the student shift towards an internal locus of control by discussing their agency, effort, and strategies. Ask questions like 'What steps can you take to achieve that grade?' or 'How can your effort influence that outcome?' rather than focusing on what they 'deserve' or will 'receive'.",
